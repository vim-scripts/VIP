VIP (VHDL Interface Plug-in) is a script for VIM text editor which provides some facilities to copy paste entities, components and instances of components.

For example you can copy the component :

component mux is   -- place the cursor on this line and enter the command :Viy (Vhdl Interface Yank)
   port (  
     INPUT  : in  std_logic_vector (15 downto 0);  
     SEL    : in  std_logic;   
     OUTPUT : out std_logic    
   );  
end component mux;

and paste it as an instance :

mux_0 : mux   -- place the cursor here and enter the command :Vii (Vhdl Interface Instance)
   port map (  
      INPUT   => s_INPUT,  
      SEL     => s_SEL,  
      OUTPUT  => s_OUTPUT  
  );

VIP can :

  - copy an entity and paste it as
          - an entity
          - a component
          - an instance

  - copy a component and paste it as
          - an entity
          - a component
          - an instance

  - copy a instance and paste it as
          - an instance (with auto-incrementation of the suffix number)

VIP tries to respect your indentation as much as possible (spaces, tabs, spaces + tabs).
It can work with many different styles of writing entities, components and instances but not all of them. See documentation.
